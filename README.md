## Hi there 👋

## Chuka Okonkwo

Senior cybersecurity analyst with 10+ years of experience in security operations, incident response, vulnerability management, and threat hunting across enterprise environments.

Guardian Logistics & Supply (GLS) is a simulated premier global third-party logistics (3PL) and supply chain management enterprise. With a vast network of physical distribution centers and a complex digital backbone, GLS serves as the critical link for international commerce. As a Senior Security Analyst, I oversee the digital "Guardian Shield" initiative—a comprehensive cybersecurity transformation designed to protect the integrity of the global supply chain through automation, proactive hunting, and AI-driven defense.

Organizational Scale & Infrastructure
 * Industry: Global Logistics, Warehousing, and Transportation.
 * Workforce: 8,500+ employees, including a 24/7 global operations team.
 * Footprint: 45 international distribution hubs across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.
 * Endpoints: 12,000+ managed devices, including corporate workstations, ruggedized warehouse handhelds, and IoT tracking sensors.
 * Identity: A hybrid Microsoft Entra ID environment managing internal staff and over 2,000 external vendor identities.
 * Cloud Architecture: A "Cloud-First" hybrid model utilizing Azure for mission-critical ERP systems while maintaining legacy on-premises servers for local warehouse management.

The Security Landscape (The "Why")
GLS operates in an environment where downtime translates to significant loss in revenue. The primary threat vectors include:
 * Supply Chain Ransomware: Targeted attacks on inventory databases to halt global shipping operations.
 * Credential Harvesting: High-frequency phishing targeting logistics coordinators to gain access to financial systems.
 * Data Exfiltration: Insider and external threats attempting to steal sensitive proprietary shipping manifests and client PII.

Technical Defense Stack
My role involves the implementation and management of the following SC-200 aligned technologies:
| Pillar | Technology Implementation | Strategic Goal |
|---|---|---|
| SIEM / SOAR | Microsoft Sentinel | Centralize logs and automate 70% of common triage tasks via Logic Apps. |
| Endpoint Security | Defender for Endpoint | Deploy EDR across all global warehouse tablets and corporate laptops. |
| Identity Protection | Microsoft Entra ID | Enforce Conditional Access and automated risk-based sign-in policies. |
| Data Governance | Microsoft Purview | Implement DLP to prevent the unauthorized sharing of sensitive supply chain manifests. |
| AI Operations | Security Copilot | Utilize generative AI to accelerate incident investigation and response times. |
